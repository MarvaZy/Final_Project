# Final_Project
## **Search engine for selected Israeli vegan recipe sites**
The project produces on the user computer a database of all the recipes from the four selected sites:
* tivoneat.co.il
* markivsodi.co.il
* theveganati.com
* veg.co.il/recipes

Therefore, allows the construction of complex queries to find the right recipe.
The query consists of the requested recipe category (from a list of built-in categories, such as breakfast, desserts, etc.), nutritional sensitivities (for example allergies), and preferences for the ingredients that will appear in the recipe.

### **Installation Guide**
Before running the project, you must first download MySQL to your computer. After downloading the software and setting the personal password, you must first run 'db_script', **after changing the password to the user-defined password**.
The code must then be run in each of the modules designed for the four sites:
* Tivoneat.py
* MarkivSodi.py
* TheVeganati.py
* Veg.py

Which will enter the recipe information from these sites into the database on your computer.

### **How to Use the Search Engine?**
After installation, run 'Search.py', and fill out the requested information.
Recipes that will match the requirements enterd by user will appear, with links.
